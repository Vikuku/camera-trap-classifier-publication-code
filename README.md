# Code for _Identifying Animal Species in Camera Trap Images using Deep Learning and Citizen Science_

This repo provides the research code used in this study. We strongly recommend to use the following repo
https://github.com/marco-willi/camera-trap-classifier to train new models. The only purpose of this repo is to provide reproducability of our results.


## Geting the Image Data

The data has been published under DOI:...

It can be downloaded ...

And extracted ....

## Code Structure

### config
Configuration file: models, paths and credentials.

### learning
File to run the training process. Heavily relies on Keras. Also contains different models.

### tools
Different helper functions, e.g. fetching data, classes for projects, experiments and subjects.

## Examples

```
git clone https://github.com/marco-willi/camera-trap-classifier-publication-code.git
